## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Error
**Problem:** null-log needs administrator/root access to read system logs.

**Solution:**
- **Windows:** Right-click PowerShell → "Run as Administrator"
- **Linux/macOS:** Use `sudo ./null-log live`

---

### "No logs found"
**Problem:** Log sources aren't available on your system.

**Solution:**
- **Windows:** Event Log should be available by default
- **Linux:** Install `systemd` (usually pre-installed)
- **macOS:** System Integrity Protection might block access

---

### "Binary won't run"
**Problem:** Downloaded the wrong version or security software blocked it.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you downloaded the right version for your OS
2. On Windows, you may need to:
   - Right-click → Properties → "Unblock"
   - Add exception to antivirus (it's a security tool, so antivirus gets suspicious!)
